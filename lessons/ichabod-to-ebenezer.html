          <h2>1. Narrative Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Chapter 4 closes with the grim birth-name Ichabod (&ldquo;the glory has departed&rdquo;) because Israel treated the ark like a talisman
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa4-3-5" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 4:3-5">1 Samuel 4:3-5</span>;
            <span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa4-21" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 4:21">1 Samuel 4:21</span>).
            Chapter 7 culminates with a memorial stone named Ebenezer (&ldquo;stone of help&rdquo;) because the people returned to the LORD Himself
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa7-12" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 7:12">1 Samuel 7:12</span>).
            The shift is not about moving the ark geographically but about moving the nation spiritually from presumption to repentance.
          </p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>
              The arc of the passage follows a fourfold rhythm: <strong>lament</strong> over loss, <strong>repentance</strong> of idolatry,
              <strong>intercession</strong> through God-appointed mediation, and <strong>remembrance</strong> of grace.

            Hophni and Phinehas, died.
          </blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>A threefold defeat.</strong> The Philistines fought like desperate men, Israel coasted because the ark was present,
              and God refused to bless superstition. The LORD is personal, not programmable
              (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa4-5-8" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 4:5-8">1 Samuel 4:5-8</span>;

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Casualties multiplied.</strong> About 30,000 soldiers fell, over seven times the loss that first prompted Israel to grab the ark
              (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa4-10" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 4:10">1 Samuel 4:10</span>;
              <span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa4-2" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 4:2">1 Samuel 4:2</span>). Archaeology even preserves an inscription from Izbet Sarteh that William H. Shea translated as naming Hophni,
              a view debated in subsequent scholarship. Shea lays out the reading in the “Translation” section on page 63 (PDF p.5) of his 1990 article,
              Lawrence J. Mykytiuk critiques it beginning on page 69 of his 1998 study, and Shea offers a two-page rejoinder (pp.277–278) defending his hpny reading,
              while a 1991 <em>Ministry Magazine</em> piece summarizes the debate under “Deciphering the ostracon”

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Idolatry unmasked.</strong> God took away what Israel idolized. The ark was good, commanded, and holy; yet elevating it above God Himself turned reverence into idolatry
              (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa4-11" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 4:11">1 Samuel 4:11</span>;
              <span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa5-1-4" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 5:1-4">1 Samuel 5:1-4</span>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Judgment fulfilled.</strong> Hophni and Phinehas died the same day, just as God promised as a sign of justice on Eli's house
              (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa2-34" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 2:34">1 Samuel 2:34</span>).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The theological warning is clear: reverence must precede reliance. Symbols cannot replace surrender, and God rescues people, not mascots.

          <h2>3. <span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa7-2-6" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 7:2-6">1 Samuel 7:2-6</span>: Lament and Repentance</h2>
          <h3>7:2: Lament Without Change</h3>
          <p>
            For twenty years the ark rested in Abinadab's house at Kirjath Jearim while Israel lamented under Philistine domination
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa7-2" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 7:2">1 Samuel 7:2</span>).
            They mourned the fallout of sin without yet addressing the sin itself.
          </p>
          <h3>7:3-4: Wholehearted Repentance</h3>
          <p>
            Samuel resurfaced with a prophet's clarity: &ldquo;If you return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods&rdquo;
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa7-3" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 7:3">1 Samuel 7:3</span>).
            Repentance had to be inward first and outwardly verified. Baal and Ashtoreth promised rain, crops, and sensuality,
            but they enslaved Israel twice over (spiritually and politically). The people proved their renewed hearts by discarding the idols.
          </p>
          <h3>7:5-6: Corporate Humility at Mizpah</h3>
          <p>
            At Samuel's call, Israel gathered at Mizpah, drew water, poured it out before the LORD, fasted, and confessed,
            &ldquo;We have sinned against the LORD.&rdquo; Their actions formed a liturgy of humility: emptiness, hunger for God alone,
            and honest confession (see <span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="lam2-19" data-verse-label="Lamentations 2:19">Lamentations 2:19</span>;
            <span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1jn1-9" data-verse-label="1 John 1:9">1 John 1:9</span>).

          <h3>7:7: Fear Revisited</h3>
          <p>
            When the Philistines advanced on Mizpah, Israel panicked
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa7-7" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 7:7">1 Samuel 7:7</span>). Earlier they had false confidence while clutching the ark;
            now they felt fear even while rightly humbling themselves. Feelings are unreliable gauges of victory; God's presence is.
          </p>
          <h3>7:8-9: Intercession and Atonement</h3>
          <p>
            This time Israel did not reach for the ark; they reached for a mediator: &ldquo;Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us&rdquo;
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa7-8-9" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 7:8-9">1 Samuel 7:8-9</span>).
            Samuel offered a suckling lamb as a whole burnt offering and cried out on their behalf. The sacrificial blood acknowledged
            that sin deserves death, while the mediator prefigured Jesus, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="jn1-29" data-verse-label="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>) and always lives to intercede for us
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="heb7-25" data-verse-label="Hebrews 7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>).
          </p>
          <h3>7:10-12: Thunder, Pursuit, Memorial</h3>
          <p>
            As Samuel sacrificed, the LORD thundered, confounding the Philistines while emboldening Israel
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa7-10-11" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 7:10-11">1 Samuel 7:10-11</span>). The rout stretched to Beth Car,
            the kind of victory Israel longed for back in chapter 4 but could only receive on the far side of repentance.
            Samuel raised a memorial stone, naming it Ebenezer and proclaiming, &ldquo;Thus far the LORD has helped us.&rdquo;
            This remembering posture looks backward with gratitude and forward with trust. It ultimately points to Christ,
            the living cornerstone and true &ldquo;stone of help&rdquo;
            (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1pe2-4-6" data-verse-label="1 Peter 2:4-6">1 Peter 2:4-6</span>).

              <strong>Remember intentionally.</strong> Raise &ldquo;Ebenezer&rdquo; moments so past grace fuels present faith

            Loving someone seeks their glory and good; using them leverages their power for our agenda.
            Israel &ldquo;used&rdquo; God by parading the ark like a good-luck charm, but love looks like the Mizpah posture of surrender and obedience

              <strong>What stood out?</strong> The stark contrast between Ichabod and Ebenezer, the same ark that highlighted defeat became the backdrop for grace once the people repented.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What does this passage reveal about God?</strong> He is holy, personal, and free. He will not be manipulated, yet He gladly fights for the repentant when they seek Him through His chosen mediator
              (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa7-10" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 7:10">1 Samuel 7:10</span>).

            <li>
              <strong>How does it point us to Jesus?</strong> Samuel's lamb offering and intercession foreshadow Jesus, the Lamb and Advocate whose once-for-all sacrifice opens the way for deliverance

            <li>
              <strong>What does it say about us?</strong> We are prone to grab symbols instead of surrendering hearts, yet when we confess and obey we position ourselves for God to turn defeats into testimonies.

              <strong>Using God as a charm.</strong> Whenever I expected God to bless my plans simply because &ldquo;I'm on His team,&rdquo; I met frustration.
              Breakthrough came when I slowed down, confessed hidden idols, and asked what obedience looked like before pleading for outcomes
              (<span class="scripture-ref" data-verse-id="1sa4-3-5" data-verse-label="1 Samuel 4:3-5">1 Samuel 4:3-5</span>).

            <li>
              <strong>Witnessing restoration.</strong> I have watched God rebuild a family that, like Israel, owned their sin together. I am currently praying for the Lord to thunder against lies holding a friend captive and to raise an Ebenezer in their story.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Surrender over control.</strong> In my life surrender has looked like pouring out my plans before the Lord, inviting trusted believers to help smash modern idols, and letting Jesus define success
